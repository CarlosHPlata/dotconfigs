	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  WARNING THIS FILE REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE
						lsp_config.lua
	FILE FIRST IN YOUR PLUGINS
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  this will make your life easier, is just a linter integrated with vim it also does auto identation
  is best than the old CoC that was difficult to configure
  Check here:
    https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim

  If you are using Mason you can install first the formatters and linters
  (Mason is installed from the lsp_config file, no need to add it)
    :Mason

  add diagnostics like:
    null_ls.builtins.diagnostics.stylua

  Note:
    there was a deprecation of unmantained lsp formatters check this thread:
      https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim/discussions/81
    You can install those deprecated by installing the extras:
      https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls-extras.nvim

  How to install new formatters:
    1. check with :Mason the available formatters or linters
    2. add it to the null_ls.builtins for setup
    *3*. Chekc that was not deprecated otherwise look for other solution
